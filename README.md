# Cohesive-sediment-transport-and-flocculation-modeling-framework-for-current-bottom-boundary-layer
The present modeling framework integrates dilute cohesive sediment transport and flocculation dynamics in a statistically steady and fully developed current bottom boundary layer. This model requires four input profiles:

-	Discrete depth distance (d_x3)
-	Turbulent shear rate (dGsed)
-	Turbulent diffusivity coefficient for the sediment (Kt)
-	Sediment concentration (tav_MassC). 
-	
All input profiles must have identical dimensions and be discretized in .mat format. The framework's functionality is controlled by the Main.m file.
